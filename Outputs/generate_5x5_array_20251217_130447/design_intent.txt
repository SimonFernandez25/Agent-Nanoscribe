The user's design goal is to create a symmetrical 5x5 array of cylinders, each with a uniform height of 5 and a radius of 1, ensuring that the center-to-center spacing between each cylinder is consistently set at 5 units. This arrangement emphasizes geometric regularity and optical coherence, resulting in a structured and visually balanced formation.
